Tests
-----------------------------------------------------------------
- There is one and only one main with return type void or int 
  and has an empty paramlist and only implemented once
- Main returns an int or nothing.

Var Declarations:
- The Type is an int or a class name
- The Name hasn't been declared as a sibling

Constructor Declarations:
- No return statement or return is empty
- Parameters are reachable
- Accesses a parameter over a global variable
- Not every class must have a constructor
- Constructor must be named the same as the class

Method Declarations:
- The return statement matches the resultType
- You cannot return void
- If no return statement, it returns zero or null 
- Parameters are reachable
- Accesses a parameter over a global variable

Parameter List:
- Each parameter is an int or the type is a class name
- No parameter name is used twice

Local Var Declarations:
- The Type is an int or a class name
- The Name hasn't been declared as a sibling
- The local var is accessed over a global var

Statement:
- Name has same type as Expression
  + this => enclosing class
  + identifier => declared variable
  + dot => declared variable in appropriate class
  + brackets => *-dimensional array with appropriate index (int)
  + Array return types must be valid
- Blocks enclose variable declarations
- this is only used with dot op 

Expression: 
- ArgList has right number and types of parameters
- ArgList parameters have been declared in the current scope
- Operator expressions are ints
- Relational ops return 1 if true and 0 if false
- && and || only take 1 or 0
- Eq operators can compare any type to null or only ints
- null is a reference type to any class or array
- read returns an int and takes no params
- print returns void and takes 0 or more ints as parameters
- Constructor methods can't be called without new

New Expression:
- Bracketed simple type expressions have right number of brackets 
- Brackest can only contain ints or be empty
- new allocates memory, calls constructor, and returns reference 
  to object, even if default constructor is called.
- Constructor parameters must match and rhs = lhs
- Brackets containing an int can only be followed by one empty []
